# A Deep Reinforcement Learning Perspective on Internet Congestion Control
- Uses RL to control the congestion control of a sender
- Uses temporal data of the previous latency, throughput, and loss so can be decentralized
- Achieves better results than CUBIC and can adapt quickly to changing network enviornments
- Show Reward Function and Figure 7
- THINGS TO ADD: Since I am doing an SDN I have global view of the network so add Jaine's fairness metric and QoS
  - QoS could be used as the danger zones that were talked about in the past
