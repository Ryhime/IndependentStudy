# Topology
- Can use Internet Topology Zoo each node has a queue size and queue policy (like FIFO)
- Make sure to use multiple topologies instead of just one


# Generating Artifical Network Traffic
- Two things to consider:
  - How often to send a packet through the network
  - Where to send the packet (src, dest)
- Can use different distributions like normal
- Can use random
- Have nodes simulate different network use types like large file transfer, internet gaming (lots of small packets), and random light load of packets
- Should ideally test all of those

# Simulating Delays
- Want to capture the following delays:
  - Processing, Queueing, Transmission, and Propagation Delay
  - The associated delays can also be used as features on the Metric Prediction module

# Measurements
- Average Throughput Delay
- NEED MORE.....
